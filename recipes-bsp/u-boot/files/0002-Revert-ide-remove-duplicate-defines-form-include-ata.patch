Subject: [PATCH] Revert "ide: remove duplicate defines form include/ata.h"

This reverts commit 04571bec56a53c846f072fb3bc7543586f10ee93.

Supposedly, the defines that were removed were redundant, but the
default values were in fact different, and we depend on the versions
that were removed.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [ota-specific]
